        A by product of an industry that overtly sexualizes both men and women, an Incel is usually <abbr title="in short a women hater">based</abbr>, trolling women and the LGBTQIA++ Community
        A rarer type of incel is a <abbr title="A female Incel, although quite rare still exists">femcel</abbr> which is a man hater. Both Incels and Femcels are involved in sexist behaviour
        These neckbeards can be usually seen in herds in their natural habitat; Reddit. A breeding ground for alt-Right and femboys alike causing tension and unneccessary strife when meeting people online
        we need reform to stop these vile creatures from spreading their neckbeards propaganda and infecting more of the youth with this cancer
